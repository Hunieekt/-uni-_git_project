## Background 

 an application that can import the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) data and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data. 

## Features

1. meet the reuqirements

2. the timer is divided into multiple renderings in order to load all map data without freezing

   > - - - Please note: Your browser will start to freeze if you plot more than 100 points at once. We will assume our client is okay with this plotting issue. Any 100 unique coordinates will do. Any 100 squirrel sightings will do. A simple slice of the database records is sufficient.

3.  Bootstrap4
